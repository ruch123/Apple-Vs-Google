,pros,cons
1,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension)."
2,"1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.","1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires t… Show More"
3,You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.,I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.
4,#NAME?,"- Google is a big company. So there are going to be winners and losers when it comes to career growth. Due to the high hiring bar, most people who don't win are smart people as well and their experience sours. This place is optimized to avoid false positi"
5,"Teamwork, always someone who can help, competitive, fun environment, free food, intelligent colleagues everywhere",not family-friendly now that I have kids - I don't wan to spend time playing ping pong and taking advantage of free fun events. I want to get home with my kids.

9,"Incredibly smart coworkers, best tools I've ever used, silly offices, free food, one project can affect millions of people and dollars.","Imposter syndrome. For me, long commute. Twenty percent time is hard to make time for. The delicious food will make you fat."
10,Seemingly unlimited resources; work with top/diverse talent from across the globe; amazing perks from food to testing of prototype consumer technologies.,Extremely competitive; take home pay is not as high as non-Googlers assume it is; many poorly socialized individuals around.
11,Everyone is vibrant and high-energy. Truly a fun place to get your nerd on. Oh and we do work sometimes. The campus is huge and contains many perks such as a gym and cafeteria.,The projects are fast paced so be prepared. We work nonstop although it's not always a serious environment. During breaks we tend to avoid talking about work because we are always so busy with it.
12,Smart people who are passionate about their job.,Tons of bureaucracy. Promotions are made unnecessarily difficult.
13,There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield).,"The company is becoming bigger and bigger each year, which brings on its own problems."

17,Amazing place to work - great people and great benefits,This is not a place to coast - come ready to make a difference.
18,Exciting to work in a company that powers billions of people's lives everyday.,Becoming more conventional as size grows with a limited scope of what one can do.
19,#NAME?,"- Size of the company is huge, so don't expect startup culture."
20,"Very impactful work, great coworkers, good work-life balance, some interesting projects.","Due to the size of the company, different divisions of Google have different cultures. It can be hard for job applicants to know which divisions they want to work in."
21,"There benifits are good,and it will bring you a lot of good things for your family.",Good company ever...i recomment to any one who is currently looking for there good job.
22,"Google is the best company to work for. The perks are amazing, every detail is considered! The work is interesting and colleagues smart and fun to work with.",It can be a little intimidating when everyone is at the top of their game. When everyone's a high performer it's very hard to stand out.
23,"Google deserves every bit of its ""Best Company to Work For"" reputation. My own experience was in getting to build a business from scratch inside the company and watching it flourish.","The bureaucracy and big company feel is starting to creep in. Despite a ""Bureaucracy Busters"" campaign, there are days I feel like I am attaching a cover sheet to my TPS report."
24,"Good infrastructure, good people to work with, nice perks.",The company is too big to get anything done reasonably easy.
25,"Amazing benefits, good pay, extremely intelligent people, engaging work that impacts a lot of people. Managers are competent, and promotion is meritocratic.",Main offices are in expensive areas. Oncall rotations interfere with work-life balance.
26,Great perks. Flexible schedule. Meet great people.,To many managers. To many meetings. Favoritism place a huge role with management.
27,"There are so many great benefits at Google. Food, exercise classes, and the work spaces are just great. Great sense of freedom and that you are in control of what you're working on",Google is a huge company. Sometimes feels like you get lost in what you're doing. Great company but definitely feels big.

30,#NAME?,#NAME?
31,Great smart people. All the usual perks,Flat structure means career movement can be difficult
32,"Great place as long as your team is good. If your team is not that good, you always have the option to switch.",Career growth depends heavily on team and manager.
33,I learn a lot. Google pays for my Masters degree at Stanford.,"My teammates are not great at English, and sometimes results in miscommunication. It's a team-specific problem though, my other Googler friends don't have this problem."
34,"Huge Impact, lots of interesting people you work with, people get excited every time you mention you work there. Overall though I really enjoyed working there and would recommend.","Lots of management overhead, does move slowly, especially on the engineering side, which means you sometimes have to sit on your hands. Also there's a decent amount of back and forth from middle management on direction."
35,You will learn more here than anywhere else you've worked.,Work life Balance
36,Great coworkers and a ton of opportunities.,It is too boring to work there.
37,"Very friendly people and very interesting work. The working environment is very nice and we only need to worry about work we are responsible for, and anything else is well taken care of by other assistants and applications.",A common problem with large companies: it is a lot competition to climb up the latter from an ordinary engineer.
38,#NAME?,#NAME?
39,"Huge resources available, world-class brilliant people to work with. Great place to learn how to scale real-world systems.","It has become a big company. It's leaner and less bureaucratic than most big companies, but it's still a big company."
40,"It's a good company, good place to work and good place to learn.","Nothing specific, haven't had any issues working here."
41,"Good opportunities, mobility, good reward",Company is very very big
42,"Everything you've ever heard about working at Google is true. Benefits are awesome, coworkers are awesome, and your work affects millions of people.","Politics are starting to get in the way of engineering. Since launches are incentivized so heavily in promo process, negative dogfood feedback is often ignored on the way to launch, with few or no consequences."
43,"Great perks, amazing technology, inspiring activities","Very biased towards whatever engineering wants, creating unfair conditions for everyone else."
44,The company offers generous perks. The locations of headquarters and other offices are great.,"Associate directors, directors, and senior directors are engaged in political battles. Promotions are very political"
45,great environment and place to work,hours can be long sometimes
46,"Food, Google Bus, Great culture, upward mobility, independent office hours","Not in San Francisco, traffic getting worse, sometimes too focused internally"
47,Work with top notch people and learn how to build product for millions of users.,Not a small company. It's slow to deploy product changes and as a product person you'll spend way more time building consensus and getting approval for launching something than actually building the product.
48,"Google is still full of bright motivated people, working on world-class products. The company is led by solid people, who truly care about continuing to make the world a better place.","The company is a lot bigger than it used to be, and though it's done better than most, it can't help slowing down as it grows. Some of the reasons I came to work at Google when it was 1000 employees are no longer true."
49,"Awesome benefits and ability to work remotely or from other offices, free food is a major plus as well",Most jobs are in MTV where cost of living is extremely high even when making almost $100K
50,great work environment,long hours but I think everything makes up for it
51,hard to get in,nice salary and internal work environment
52,Google is as advertised - it's an amazing place to work full of incredibly smart people working on interesting and challenging problems. The pay and perks are great. In theory there is a lot of opportunity for mobility and Google does seem committed to developing people over the course of their careers.,"Some Googlers are incredibly entitled and complain about mundane issues. It's less nimble than it used to be. Certain organizations (People Operations) are bureaucratic and very top-down in leadership style, which is antithetical to the way Google portrays itself."
53,Google was a great company to work.,It is too comfortable. You must get out of comfort zones. It might be a great company to work. But remember every big company in the past such as Microsoft was like that.
54,Great Learning Opportunities,Difficult Work but worth the challenge
55,Its a fun place to work,Some people take advantage of it too much
56,"Flexible hours, awesome benefits, amazing coworkers!",Work was hard but fair. Sometimes the work felt like it never ended.
57,Work with the smartest people. Fast paced. Challenging.,Will burn you out. Gives whatever you are willing to sacrifice.
58,"strong financial, lavish perks, smart people to learn from","little impact, small rolls, politics, people just waiting for retirement there"
59,Google is probably the best corporate environment to work in. A lot of opportunities to get exposed to things outside of your immediate job. Strong brand allows you to open many doors. Of course the perks have,Google is far from being a startup and it slowly becomes more and more corporate. Selecting a team and evaluating its culture before joining becomes more important to make sure your expectations match your team's.
60,1. Work with smart people in a great company,1. Limited impact.
61,"Very creative atmosphere, and the quality of people you work with is noticeably better than anywhere else.","I can't think of any yet, other than all the cons that go with working for a Big Corporate Machine."
62,google has a very flexible culture. You can benefits from learning experience from other geeks.,"Since it is already a huge company. So probably some of the projects at google are not as challenging as before. If you want to solve challenging problem, then it's not the perfect place."
63,great place to work as a fulltime/intern,can not think of any
64,Some of the best perks in the industry.,The office politics are harsh.
65,"Great people (generally smart, friendly, and hard-working)","Lack of opportunity for senior talent (staff and above) to really make a dent in the organization. This, coupled with the very slow promo process (1.5 years / level) and Google's tendency to downlevel on hire can be very frustrating. To some extent, I felt like I had to simply wait for leadership to retire or play the political game to get much further in my career."
66,"Good benefits, Smart people, great culture","Ambiguous environment, not easy to navigate for a lot of ppl"
67,"Talented people, interesting projects, good perks and benefits.",Big big big - lots of politics/ nothing moves. Leadership skills of leaders on average is low since tech acumen valued by leadership is not.
68,It was great. It was a different time but it was great.,A little scattered at times. This was part of the fun.
69,"Overall work and life balance is promoted through various incentives. The people are bright and great to work with. Free breakfast and lunch! Google offers multiple perks. There's interest groups for about anything, volunteering opportunities, and projects outside your domain expertise to get involved with. You have a portal to learn various skills on your own or on your expertise at about anytime as long as you sign… Show More",Communication between team members out side of the weekly team meeting had no consistency.Team is separated into focus areas specialized for each member and the overall team which can have constraints for those who are not self thought or self starters. Team may feel distant at times if it's divided by offices. Expect to hit the workload at light speed while making sure you are ALWAYS on top of everything so that it'… Show More
70,"Even though I am not an employee of Google, I still get many of the perks like food and coffee and the gym",The company is getting so big that standards can be different from org to org causing confusion for employees
71,Colleagues and managers were extremely supportive,"Lots of bureaucracy, which is normal and expected for such a large company"
72,Salary and benefits are decent,Unless you are level 5+ your opinion is meaningless
73,"Incredibly brilliant people, very comfortable amenities and perks. The opportunity to solve (mostly) really interesting challenges and problems at a HUGE scale.",Your experience varies so much based on your team and who your manager is. More training needed for people to actually manage and get the most out of people. Great perks don't make up for the other parts.
74,"- Work is technically challenging. Not incremental stuff, 50% devoted to ambitious work",#NAME?
75,"food, intelligent people, great access to resource and mentors","basically none, it was great"
76,It's Google after all! I had a great time working there and my co-workers were quite supportive.,The workload was quite heavy and sometime I had to work late nights.
77,#NAME?,Workload can be daunting at times when you want to just sit back and relax. Not really that place unless you are super smart.
78,Free food- they have professional chefs,Politics - too much focus on titles and ranks sucking up to other people
79,Great culture.,"As the company grew bigger, politics started trickling in."
80,perks (lots of free stuff),"getting larger, more bureaucratic"

84,Independent working ethics for staff,projects can easily be shut down
85,"nice people, and great benefits",difficult to transition full-time for most
86,If is full time could be perfect,Is perfect it doesn't have any negative
87,"During the time I was at Google, I have had the pleasure to work with smart, savvy, and dedicated people who truly have passions for what we do - it is contagious.",Nothing really major from my opinion.
88,"All benefits on food, drink. Well life-work balance and provide good environment to work.","No, everything works perfectly. Its very hard to say cons."
89,Super awesome place I need one more word.,Totally nothing is bad about the GooG!
90,Everyday is an exciting challenge. The people are incredible.,Can get a bit competitive at times (in a good way).
91,Really loyal place to work like a family.,Dont want to leave some days
92,"Great people, awesome culture (people are Googley), gourmet food.",Advancement is a bit hit and miss. You can get stuck on a dead-end project (and there are surprisingly many of those at Google).
93,A lot of freedom for charting your own path. A lot more encouragement to make yourself productive than being pressured to be productive.,"The size of the company shows. You have to work at group speed, mostly think and work the group way. Slow growth curve."
94,Great area and good pay,Lots of competition and hard to move up
95,free food management cares about their employees.,Working with too many talented and creative people can result in clashing of the minds
96,Very good atmosphere to work,I dont have any thing to say bad about the company
97,"tons of perks, dog friendly",no major cons to mention
98,"high salary, good insurance and benefits","high tax, high expense to live"
99,many money and good benefit.,too big to do something
100,"Lot of opportunity for work and fun. Agree that is #1 place to work for. Good food, good peers and good projects.",Company becoming big....lots of team to interact and work with. Work life balance compromised if not paid attention to.

103,Great atmosphere and the schedule is very flexible,Can get hectic at times
104,"A lot of responsibility. Exciting. Fantastically smart, capable, and fun colleagues. Great salary and benefits. Lots of international travel. Entrepreneurial culture.","In general: a lot of people are slacking at the moment. They don't really care about what they're doing. Company lacks proper processes, accountability, and avoids conflict to the point that it languishes dangerously."
105,"Super smart people, great infrastructure, access to lots of users. Potential for big impact.","Lots of inertia, due to size. Bureaucratic and political."
106,"Lots of things to learn. Free food, gyms, bike, shuttle, laundry; smart people, now, what else do I miss?",There are lots of different internal systems which you can build things upon. But the learning curve is steep - take a long time to ramp up.
107,"fun and intellectually stimulating work environment, great people",big organization and it's hard to get noticed
108,Access/exposure to a lot of cool projects before they are widely known to the public and your foot in the door to landing a full time position with the company,"The program was very unstructured. A lot of us were confused what were could and couldn't do after ""orientation."" If you ask me, a lot of the events hosted by ambassadors representing the company were poorly run/planned which in turn made the company look bad (some ambassadors did a better job than others)"
109,this job has really given me insight out the job game really works. I learned how to develop software in my spare time and always love the cafeteria,"there is really no downside to Google. As an employee, I have access to resources and great training and coaching. Please hire my friends as well."
110,I worked at Google for over 7 years. It is the longest that I have worked at any company. That is a testimonial to how good the company is! I left Google because I wanted to try my hand at starting my own company or joining an early stage start up.,"Over the years, Google has become more bureaucratic. Unfortunately, several groups are working in the same area and the usual turf battles happen. Also, it has become harder to change projects than before."
111,"Work with some of the smartest and most creative talent around, contribute to a company that makes a significant impact in the daily lives of billions of users, enjoy all the amazing benefits and perks.",The large size of the company has produced bureaucracy and several layers of teams/departments/orgs that can slow down decision making and progress.
112,"Very good working environment, smart people, great benefit. Also a very good work - life balance",Starts to become a little bit too big and is more like a big corporation now..
113,"Great benefits, surrounded by smart/motivated people, lots of perks, locations around the world, 401K match, health benefits are outstanding",Getting way to big. Levels are everything to everyone. Lower pay than other startups. Inequity of treatment between the sales side and the engineering side of the businesses.
114,"Amazing place to learn, grow, and have a scaled impact","Large, corporate, and difficult to rise up after a certain point in your career"
115,"The culture is amazing! What you read in the articles about the perks and people is absolutely true. It's great to work at a company that offers 3 meals a day Monday-Friday, where I feel comfortable around 100% of the people and where you have the ability to make your own schedule.",Google is still a big and established company. There will still be a corporate hierarchy that will take months or years to change compared to quick feedback within a startup.
116,Good for most of the things,"Meal, policy. and so on"
117,Getting to work for Google. Great culture outside of the ITRP program.,"They will lie to recruit you, and promise training, ops roations, and learning opportunities that never happen."
118,All of the perks are incredible!,The commute is tough from SF
119,"Google spoils its employees. Free breakfast lunch and dinner, great amenities, and budgets never seem to be an issue (at other jobs I've had to beg travel budget -- at Google, I can pretty much take any trip I think is worthwhile). They also do tons to reduce friction as an employee.",It *is* a big company. Things don't turn on a dime; there is a lot of process. And it is *very* engineering directed.

And the compensation and perks are very generous. As the person leading the orientation told me on my first day: ""We want you to be happy. If you're happy you're more productive."" I'm happy indeed :)","Work-life balance can be difficult, not necessarily due to management asking you to work off-hours, but because sometimes it's hard to disconnect."

133,"Great perks, very smart people, great atmosphere, good leadership. Overall, very nice company to work for and a lot to learn from. Good compensation doesn't hurt.","Sometimes people can get overly competitive. While it's good to have many young people in the company, some are arrogant and entitled. Depending on the group, some could have fratty culture."

140,"The perks are legendary here. Contrary to rumors, the food quality is still very good, some of the newer cafes on the main campus get rave reviews. Get to work with lots of very smart people, with mostly good attitudes. Very academic atmosphere where research and analysis of data is the preferred way to guide decisions.","Very crowded campuses, easy to feel lost in a sea of employees. Free food, but nowhere to sit down and eat it. Not always easy to spend time on ""20 percent time"" projects as advertised. Lots of internal bureaucracy, surveys, and distractions of optional employee-oriented programs. Self-promotion is encouraged, so prepare to toot your own horn and compete for recognition of your project if you want to get promoted"
141,"Lots of opensource , good environment",food is not good. tasty is not good too.
142,"You'll be surrounded by very smart people, which helps your professional growth; compensation & benefits make you feel valued by the company","Because there are so many smart people, the company can hire overqualified people for a given position, which can ultimately adversely impact job satisfaction"
143,"Great coworkers, detailed docs and a lot of learning materials to help you become a good engineer.",1. There is not so much work to do.
144,Google is a great company at the forefront of technological advancement. The pay and hours are good and the work culture is laid back.,"There are enough talented people that being talented won't guarantee you an inside track on good projects, because there are thousands of equally smart people ahead in the queue and equally underutilized, but there are just enough bozos that you have to prove that you're not one of them"
145,"Product and tech leadership are outstanding, no one else is doing what Google is and succeeding.","Sales / business side is becoming political, zero sum game and bureaucratic."

Not every engineer you'll work with is amazing, some are just good, and a few are mediocre. However, so many are amazing that it's an absolute pleasure to work on the same codebase as they do.","Mountain View-centric attitude leads to extreme commute times. This is the largest negative about working here, and I probably would have left by now if I wasn't able to work from home or the SF office most of the week. I'm sure if you live in boring suburbia it'd be fine, but I don't want to do that."

158,Google has the clout and money necessary to provide all the resources necessary to succeed.,"I guess I didn't drink the Kool-Aid. Google has been a major success story in building the web into what it is today. However, most of the management and employees have fallen in love with their own intelligence. This is very bad news for the future growth of the company. Additionally, Google is very risk adverse no matter that they have a ""moonshot"" factory. They don't stick to their goals when there are set backs."

Based on my experience, I would say the Engineer culture is very different from the Sales/Business culture. The Sales/Business culture can be stodgy, dry, and incredibly 'corporate.'

263,Excellent first company to join after college. Best launchpad for career.,Promotions are based on politics. For management & HR: Many TLMs pick favorites and reduce opportunities for others by restricting project allocations. Encourage 6-month transfers to help employees find better and cohesive teams where they will happily remain and let others move.

All my time was spent in Google for Work org, which was very different from greater Google and had poor leadership. Was inconsequential enough that greater Google hadn't yet taken notice, but I predict a big shake up soon.","Opportunity for vertical movement is scarce. Hiring practices have led to hiring candidates based on who has the best resume, rather than who is the best person for the job.

Lots of opportunity to learn if you actually make the effort to do so.,Since it is such a big company you can also get lost very easily.
